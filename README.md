## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add: 
I had some trouble with routing everything and making sure datatypes matched throughout the calls between the server and client. Styling to my liking was also a bit of a challenge but other than that the lab allowed me to learn this listicle app for the most part. I didn't want to go rename everything so I used the lab as a template of sorts and messed around with it more in the end. I wanted to make something for a game I liked that did not have a very central type of website for its fanbase. I hope I can improve on this later and deploy it.
